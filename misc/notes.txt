QAP 1 Front end:

Will do project on Toyota Tacoma. I worked at Toyota Plaza selling vehicles so I'm pretty familiar with them and theyre history.

index/landing page;
    - Tacoma grill on background of site, maybe fading in on site enter?
    - Flex box rectangle in front, 80ish % opacity
    - 'Welcome to Tacoma' 
    - History page
    - Specs page
    - Reviews and awards page (youtube videos and video links)
    - Book app with closest dealer
    - gallery

General ideas:
    - TRD Colors? yellow orange red black
    - 'through the years' with the major remodels, maybe fading in out/ on click etc
    - make sure to include some audio
    - Squoosh if needed
    - No RED elements
