          <h2>1995 - 2004 Tacoma</h2>
          <p class="historyBlurb">
            The first-generation Toyota Tacoma, introduced in 1995, was a
            compact pickup truck that replaced the Toyota Hilux in the North
            American market. It focused on comfort, safety, and performance,
            catering to personal use rather than just utility. Available in
            regular cab, extended cab (Xtracab), and crew cab (Double Cab), the
            Tacoma offered two- or four-wheel drive options. <br /><br />Engine
            options included a 2.4L inline-4, a 2.7L inline-4, and a more
            powerful 3.4L V6. The first-generation Tacoma was praised for its
            reliability, off-road capability, and versatility, making it a
            popular choice among truck enthusiasts.

            continued to build on the reputation for reliability and versatility
            established by its predecessor. It featured a more rugged design and
            offered multiple body styles, including regular cab, extended cab
            (Access Cab), and crew cab (Double Cab). <br /><br />Engine options
            included a 2.7L inline-4 and a 4.0L V6, with increased power and
            improved fuel efficiency. The second-generation Tacoma was known for
            its excellent off-road capability, thanks to features like the TRD
            Off-Road package, and it remained a top choice for those seeking a
            durable and dependable mid-size pickup truck.
